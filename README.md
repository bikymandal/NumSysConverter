This Project is based on the Number System Converter where you can convert Numbers among Binary, Octal, Decimal and Hexadecimal.
<b>How to run this project:</b>
from the github link after downloading the all file just run the 'syscal' runnable file(in directory dist).
this project is suitable for Python3 so if you want to run it in terminal using the source code only then cmd is "python3 syscal.py"
Play the video Syscal.mp4 in the repository.. Thank you.
